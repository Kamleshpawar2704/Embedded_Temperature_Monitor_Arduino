# 🌡️ Embedded Temperature Monitor using Arduino

This project demonstrates real-time temperature monitoring using an **Arduino UNO** and an **LM35 Temperature Sensor**.  
It reads analog data from the LM35 sensor, converts it to Celsius, and displays results through the **Serial Monitor** and **LED alerts**.
